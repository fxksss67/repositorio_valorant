      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Thailand's prismatic radiant Waylay transforms into light itself as she darts across the battlefield, striking down her targets through shards of light before flitting back to safety, all in the blink of an eye.</p>

      <ul class="abilities-list">
        <li><strong>SATURATE:</strong> INSTANTLY throw a cluster of light that explodes upon contact with the ground, Hindering nearby players with a powerful movement and weapon slow.</li>
        <li><strong>LIGHTSPEED:</strong> EQUIP to prepare for a burst of speed. FIRE to dash forward twice. ALT FIRE to dash once. Only your first dash can send you upward.</li>
        <li><strong>REFRACT:</strong> INSTANTLY create a beacon of light on the floor. REACTIVATE to speed back to your beacon as a mote of pure light. You are invulnerable as you travel.</li>
        <li><strong>CONVERGT PATHS (Ultimate):</strong> EQUIP to focus your prismatic power. FIRE to create an afterimage of yourself that projects a beam of light. After a brief delay, you gain a powerful speed boost and the beam expands, Hindering other players in the area.</li>
      </ul>
